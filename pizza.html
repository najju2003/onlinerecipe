            <li>In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil, stirring until it forms a dough.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) and lightly grease a pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out to your desired thickness on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Top with shredded mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
